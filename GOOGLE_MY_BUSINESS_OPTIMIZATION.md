### **Step 9: Q&A Optimization**

#### **Pre-populate with Common Questions:**

**Q: How much does debt settlement cost?**
**A:** We never charge upfront fees (illegal in California). Our fees are typically 15-25% of enrolled debt, paid only after successful settlements. For example, on $50,000 enrolled debt, fees would be $7,500-$12,500, but only after we settle your accounts.

**Q: Do you serve all of Orange County?**  
**A:** Yes! We provide debt settlement services throughout Orange County including Anaheim, Irvine, Santa Ana, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, and all other OC cities.

**Q: How much can I save?**
**A:** Orange County clients typically save 40-60% of enrolled debts after our fees. Average debt reduction is 52% based on our 2,500+ completed cases since 2018.

**Q: Is debt settlement better than bankruptcy?**
**A:** Debt settlement often preserves more assets and has less long-term credit impact than bankruptcy. We provide free consultations to help determine the best option for your specific situation.
