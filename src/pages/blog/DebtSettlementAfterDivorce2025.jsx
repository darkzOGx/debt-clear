      question: "Can I settle debts assigned to my ex-spouse in the divorce?",
      answer: "If your name is still on the account, creditors can pursue you regardless of divorce decree assignments. Settlement can remove this liability. We help negotiate releases that protect you from debts assigned to your ex-spouse, ensuring creditors cannot come after you for these obligations."
    },
    {
      question: "How does divorce affect my debt settlement options in 2025?",
      answer: "Divorce actually improves settlement leverage in 2025 due to new California hardship provisions. Recent divorcees qualify for expedited settlement programs with 20-30% better terms. The financial hardship of divorce is now a recognized factor that creditors must consider in negotiations."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens to joint credit card debt after divorce?",
      answer: "Joint credit card debt remains the responsibility of both parties until settled or paid, regardless of divorce agreements. Creditors are not bound by divorce decrees. We negotiate with creditors to release you from joint obligations, often achieving 40-60% reductions specifically for divorce situations."
    },
    {
      question: "Can debt settlement help me qualify for a mortgage after divorce?",
      answer: "Yes, settling debts can significantly improve your debt-to-income ratio, crucial for mortgage qualification. Most clients see improvement within 6-12 months. By eliminating outstanding debts, you'll meet lending requirements faster and potentially qualify for better interest rates on your new home loan."
    },
    {
      question: "How quickly can I settle debts after divorce in Orange County?",
      answer: "Orange County residents typically complete divorce-related debt settlement in 3-6 months, faster than the 12-18 month average. Our local relationships with creditors and understanding of California divorce law accelerate the process. Emergency situations can be resolved in as little as 30-60 days."
    },
    {
      question: "Will debt settlement affect my children's college funds or custody arrangements?",
      answer: "Debt settlement does not affect custody arrangements or protected education savings accounts (529 plans). These assets are typically exempt. We structure settlements to protect your children's future while eliminating your debt burden, ensuring family stability during this transition."

          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            Creditors recognize divorce as a legitimate financial hardship, opening doors to better settlement terms 
            unavailable to other debtors. California's {currentYear} regulations require creditors to consider 
            divorce-related hardship, resulting in significantly improved outcomes for recent divorcees.
