          <h2>Primary IRS Settlement Programs</h2>

          <h3>Offer in Compromise (OIC)</h3>
          <p>The IRS Offer in Compromise program allows taxpayers to settle their tax debt for less than the full amount owed. The average settlement is approximately 12 cents on the dollar, though acceptance requires proving inability to pay the full amount.</p>

          <h3>Installment Agreements</h3>
          <p>For taxpayers who can pay over time, the IRS offers various installment agreement options. Streamlined agreements are available for debts under $50,000 with payment terms up to 72 months.</p>

          <h3>Currently Not Collectible Status</h3>
          <p>Taxpayers experiencing severe financial hardship may qualify for Currently Not Collectible status, which temporarily suspends IRS collection activities.</p>

          <h3>Penalty Abatement</h3>
          <p>First-time penalty abatement and reasonable cause penalty relief can eliminate thousands in IRS penalties for qualifying taxpayers.</p>
